# Packaging

Packaging an extraction plugin is handled by Maven. To package your plugin into
a container image, the following command can be used:

```bash
mvn package docker:build
```

This will generate a plugin image:

* The extraction plugin is added to your local image registry
(`docker images`),
* The image name is `extraction-plugin/PLUGINID`, e.g.
`extraction-plugin/nfi.nl/extract/chat/whatsapp`,
* The image is labeled with two tags: `latest`, and your plugin version.

.. _java_superpom_podman:

Note: if your build environment does not have Docker available, you can use
[podman](https://podman.io/) as an alternative. Install podman on your machine
or build agent, and run the following commands _before_ invoking the
`mvn package docker:build` command:

```bash
podman system service --time=0 unix:/run/user/$(id -u)/podman/podman.sock &
export DOCKER_HOST="unix:/run/user/$(id -u)/podman/podman.sock"
```
