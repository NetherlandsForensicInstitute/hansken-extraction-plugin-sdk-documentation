# Data Transformations

Extraction Plugins can create new :ref:`data-streams <datastreams>` on a Trace through data transformations. Data
transformations describe how data can be obtained from a source. Data transformations are preferred over storing blobs
because they take less space. This is because they only describe the data instead of specifying the actual data.

The following figure shows how Hansken visualizes data transformations:

Note that transformations can be applied on transformations. The SDK only supports range transformations at the moment,
while this image also shows some transformations that are currently available in Hansken but not in the SDK.

An example case is an extraction plugin that processes an archive file. The plugin creates a child trace per entry in
the archive file. Each child trace will have a data stream that is a transformation that marks the start and length of
the entry in the original archive data. By just describing the data instead of specifying the actual data, a lot of
space is saved.

Although Hansken supports various transformations, the Extraction Plugins SDK for now only supports ranged data
transformations. Ranged data transformations define data as a list of ranges, each range with an offset and length in a
bytearray.
