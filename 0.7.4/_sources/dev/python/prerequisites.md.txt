# Prerequisites

All required project dependencies to build extraction plugins are published on the public [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/hansken-extraction-plugin/).

Required:

* Python 3.8 or higher
* Java 11 (for running the test-framework, which is implemented in Java)
* Docker (for packaging and deploying extraction plugins in containers, can be omitted if you have an external build pipeline that provides Docker)
