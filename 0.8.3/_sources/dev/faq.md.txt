## How can I access Hansken developer community

You will first need git access to the Hansken developer community. Here you can find started guides and examples. If you
have no access yet, you can get access by following the next steps:

1. Sign up at [git.eminjenv.nl](https://git.eminjenv.nl/)
2. After you have created your account, you should request access to the "
   Hansken Community" group . Do this by contacting your organisations Hansken business owner. If you don't know who to
   contact as your business owner, please read the :doc:`../contact` page.

## Why use Extraction Plugins?

Extraction plugins enable you to run your own extraction code in Hansken.

* Your plugin runs during extraction
* Extraction plugins are faster than Hansken.py
* Multiple programming languages are supported
* Scalability: Extraction plugins can be scaled flexibly on a kubernetes cluster

## What programming languages are supported?

The SDK contains an API and tools to write a Hansken extraction plugin in Java or Python. The Java API can be used to
develop extraction plugins in JVM-compatible languages, such as Scala and Kotlin.

## Will you support language *foobar*?

Probably not. It takes time and effort to create a proper SDK. If you think there is a good use case to support
language *foobar*, and there is gRPC support, feel free to contact us. We can discuss the options to add support for
Hansken extraction plugins with *foobar*.

Under the hood, extraction plugins use gRPC to communicate with Hansken. In theory, all programming languages that have
a gRPC implementation can be used to write Hansken extraction plugins.

## Can I reuse or modify the Extraction Plugins SDK?

The SDK is distributed under the Apache 2.0 License, see the LICENSE file in the SDK for more details.

## Can I use a plugin that someone else wrote?

Yes, at your own risk. The Hansken Team does not take responsibility for code written by third parties in the form of
Extraction Plugins.

## What are the legal implications of creating your own Extraction Plugin(s)?

All Extraction Plugins not written by the Hansken Team are considered **third party** Extraction Plugins. Please refer
to [Can I use a plugin that someone else wrote?](faq.md#can-i-use-a-plugin-that-someone-else-wrote?)

## How safe are Extraction Plugins?

We are doing everything to make sure Extraction Plugins are as safe as possible, however note that the Extraction Plugin
SDK is still in beta. Use it at your own risk. For more information on security see [Isolation](concepts/isolation.md).

## Can my Extraction Plugin be embedded into Hansken for performance reasons?

Embedding an Extraction Plugin into Hansken requires access to the Hansken source code. If you have access to the source
code then please `../contact` us for assistance. Please note that embedded Extraction Plugins are **not officially
supported**.

If you do not have access to the Hansken source code, then please contact your own Business Owner, and ask them to
contact the Hansken Team.
