# Python API Changelog

This document summarizes all important API changes in the Extraction Plugin API. This document only shows changes that
are important to plugin developers. For a full list of changes per version, please refer to the general
:ref:`changelog <changelog>`.

.. If present, remove `..` before `## |version|` if you create a new entry after a previous release.

## |version|

* This release addresses important load balancing issues. Please use release `0.8.3` as a drop-in-replacement for releases `0.8.2` and `0.8.1`.


## 0.8.2 

* ⚠️  This release is deprecated, please upgrade to `0.8.3`

* The `build_plugin` utility has been updated and the deprecation status has been removed.
  As with `label_plugin`, `build_plugin` now no longer requires a full (virtual) environment
  with all plugin dependencies and resources. This will greatly reduce build times for plugins with
  big dependencies and/or large models.

  The first argument of the command (a pointer to your `plugin.py` file) has been removed.
  Please do not forget to remove the first argument of `build_plugin` in your `tox.ini` or other build tooling.

  For usage read further in [packaging](packaging.md).

* The default read-buffer of `trace.open('rb')` as been changed from 1 Megabyte to 6 Megabyte to reduce overhead while data reading.

* The data stream writer of `trace.open('wb')` is now buffered as well. This means that multiple small writes will be flushed after every 6 Megabytes of data has been written (or when the writer is closed).

* The read-buffer or write-buffer size can be overridden by the user, by passing the `buffer_size=` argument to `trace.open()`:

  ```python
  with trace.open('rb', buffer_size=1024*1024):  # set a 1 Megabyte buffer size
      pass

  with trace.open('wb', buffer_size=1024*1024*12):  # set a 12 Megabyte buffer size
      pass

  with trace.open('wb', buffer_size=1):  # a buffer_size of 1 effectively disables the buffer:
      pass                               # each write will be flushed to Hansken directly
  ```

* It is now possible to write `str` values to `trace.open(..)`. To do so, pass `mode='w'` as additional argument.
  By default, it is assumed that the written text is 'utf-8' encoded. The default can be overwritten by using the `'encoding='` argument.

  In a future Hansken update, Hansken will set the correct data-stream properties for your text stream (`mimeType`, `mimeClass`, and `fileType`).

  Example use cases are:

  * write picture-to-text (OCR) data to a trace
  * write translations to a trace
  * write audio-to-text (audio transcriptions) to a trace
  * write the results of a JSON dump, e.g.: `json.dump(['your', 'data'], text_writer)`

  Examples in code:

  ```python
  with trace.open(data_type='raw', mode='w', encoding='utf-8') as text_writer:
      text_writer.write('hello.world')  # write strings directly to it
      json.dump({'hello': 'world'}, text_writer)  # or pass the writer to json.dump
  ```

  See also :ref:`the python code snippet<python_snippets_data_streaming>`.


## 0.8.1

* ⚠️  This release is deprecated, please upgrade to `0.8.3`


## 0.8.0

* The trace property `imageId` is renamed to `image`. This is to be in line with the Hansken REST API and Python API.
  When updating your plugin, please update your calls `trace.get('imageId')` to `trace.get('image')`.

* [#774](https://git.eminjenv.nl/hansken/hbacklog/-/issues/774)
  By default, deferred extraction plugin searches are now scoped to the image
  of the trace that is currently being processed. Optionally, a project-wide
  search can be done by passing an optional scope argument.

  ```python
  def process(trace, data_context, searcher):
      # only search for traces inside the same image as the trace that is being processed
      searcher.search('*')
      searcher.search('*', scope='image')  # explicit alternative, using a str
      searcher.search('*', scope=SearchScope.image)  # explicit alternative, using the SearchScope enum

      # only search for traces inside the same image as the trace that is being processed
      searcher.search('*', scope='project')
      searcher.search('*', scope=SearchScope.project)
  ```

* Support trace properties of type `list[float]`. This enables you to write
  multiple offsets and confidence scores in tracelets of type prediction.

  For example:

  ```python
  trace.add_tracelet('prediction', {
      'modelName': 'my_cat_detector',
      'modelVersion': '0.0.BETA',
      'type': 'classification',
      'label': 'cat',

      # the best score
      'offset': 3.0,
      'confidence': 0.4,

      # all scores
      'offsets':     [0.0, 3.0, 6.0, 9.0],
      'confidences': [0.1, 0.4, 0.03, 0.09],
  })
  ```


## 0.7.3

* This version introduces a new docker image build utility `label_plugin`.
  This utility will eventually replace `build_plugin`. `build_plugin` is now deprecated.

  `label_plugin` is a utility to add labels to an extraction plugin image. Labeling a plugin is required for
  Hansken to detect extraction plugins in a plugin image registry.

  To label a plugin, first build the plugin image with [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/image/build/);
  for example by using one of the following commands:

  ```shell
  docker build . -t my_plugin
  docker build . -t my_plugin --build-arg https_proxy=http://your_proxy:8080
  ```

  Next, run the `label_plugin` utility to label the build plugin container:
  ```shell
  label_plugin my_plugin
  ```

  The result of `label_plugin` is a plugin image that can be :ref:`uploaded to Hansken<upload_plugin>`.

  `label_plugin` is preferred over `build_plugin`, as it does not require a full (virtual) environment
  with all plugin dependencies and resources. This is especially preferred when the plugin uses (big)
  data models or (external) dependencies.

  For usage read further in [packaging](packaging.md).


## 0.7.0

* Escaping the `/` character in matchers is optional.
  This simplifies and aims for better HQL and HQL-Lite compatability.
  See for more information and examples the :ref:`HQL-Lite syntax documentation<hqllite syntax>`.

  Examples:

  * Old: `file.path:\/Users\/*\/AppData` -> new: `file.path:/Users/*/AppData`
  * Old: `file.path:\\/Users\\/*\\/AppData` ->  new: `file.path:/Users/*/AppData`
  * Old: `registryEntry.key:\/Software\/Dropbox\/ks*\/Client-p` ->  new: `registryEntry.key:/Software/Dropbox/ks*/Client-p`

* Hansken returns `file.path` properties (outside the scope of matchers) as a `String` property,
  instead of a list of strings.
  Example: `trace.get('file.path')` now returns `'/dev/null'`, this was `['dev', 'null']`.

* Improved plugin loading when using `serve_plugin` and `build_plugin`:
  `import` statements now work for modules (python files) that are located the same directory structure of a plugin.

* A plugin can now stream data to a trace using `trace.open(mode='wb')`.
  This removes the limit on the size of data that could be written.
  See also :ref:`the python code snippet<python_snippets_data_streaming>`.

  Example:

  ```python
  with trace.open(mode='wb') as writer:
      writer.write(b'a string')
      writer.write(bytes(another_string, 'utf-8'))
  ```

  _note_: this does not work when using `run_with_hanskenpy`.

## 0.6.1

* The docker image build script `build_plugin` has been updated to allow for extension of the docker command.
  This can be especially handy for specifying a proxy. You should build your plugin container image with the following
  command:

  ```bash
  build_plugin PLUGIN_FILE DOCKER_FILE_DIRECTORY [DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME] [DOCKER_ARGS]
  ```

  .. warning:: Note that the `DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME` argument no longer requires a `-n` parameter to be specified.

  For usage read further in [packaging](packaging.md).

## 0.6.0

.. warning:: This is an API breaking change.
   Upgrading your plugin to this version will require code changes.
   Plugins built with previous versions of the SDK from `0.3.0` will still work with Hansken.

.. warning:: It is strongly recommended to upgrade your plugins to this new version because it significantly improves
   the start-up time of Hansken. See the migration steps below.

This release contains both build pipeline changes and API changes.
Please read all changes carefully.

### Build pipeline change

* Extraction plugin container images are now labeled with PluginInfo. This
  allows Hansken to efficiently load extraction plugins.
  Migration steps from earlier versions:

  1. Update the SDK version in your `setup.py` / `requirements.txt`
  2. If you come from a version prior to `0.4.0`, or if you use a plugin name
     instead of a plugin id in your `pluginInfo()`, switch to the plugin id style
     (read  instructions for version `0.4.0`)
  3. Update your build scripts to build your plugin (Docker) container image.
     Be sure to [have the Extraction Plugins SDK installed](getting_started.md#Installation).
     Then, you should build your plugin container image with the following command:

     ```bash
     build_plugin PLUGIN_FILE DOCKER_FILE_DIRECTORY -n [DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME]
     ```

     For example:
     ```bash
     build_plugin plugin/chatplugin.py . -n extraction-plugins/chatplugin
     ```

     This will generate a plugin image:

    * The extraction plugin is added to your local image registry (`docker images`),
    * Note that DOCKER\_IMAGE\_NAME is optional and will default to `extraction-plugin/PLUGINID`, e.g.
     `extraction-plugin/nfi.nl/extract/chat/whatsapp`,
    * The image is tagged with two tags: `latest`, and your plugin version.


### API changes

* The field `plugin` has been removed from `PluginInfo`.
* The field `pluginId` should now be the first argument of PluginInfo (when using unnamed arguments).

  Old (unnamed arguments):

  ```python
  def plugin_info(self):
      return PluginInfo(self, '1.0.0', 'description', author,
                        MaturityLevel.PROOF_OF_CONCEPT, '*, 'https://hansken.org',
                        PluginId(...), 'Apache License 2.0')
  ```

  New (removed `self`, and moved `PluginId(...)` to first argument position):

  ```python
  def plugin_info(self):
      return PluginInfo(PluginId(...), '1.0.0', 'description',
                        author, MaturityLevel.PROOF_OF_CONCEPT,
                        '*', 'https://hansken.org', 'Apache License 2.0')
  ```

  Old (named arguments):

  ```python
  def plugin_info(self):
      return PluginInfo(plugin=self,
                        version='1.0.0',
                        ...)
  ```

  New (removed `plugin=self`):

  ```python
  def plugin_info(self):
      return PluginInfo(version='1.0.0',
                        ...)
  ```

* Plugin `data_context.data_size` is now a variable instead of a method:

  Old:

  ```python
  def process(self, trace: ExtractionTrace, data_context: DataContext):
      size = data_context.data_size()
  ```

  New:

  ```python
  def process(self, trace: ExtractionTrace, data_context: DataContext):
      size = data_context.data_size
  ```

* Simplify declaring required runtime resources in a plugin's info.

  Extraction plugin resources don't use the builder pattern anymore.

  Old:

  ```python
  return PluginInfo(
      ...,
      resources=PluginResources.builder().maximum_cpu(0.5).maximum_memory(1000).build())
  )
  ```

  New:

  ```python
  # no need for a builder, declare resources by direct instantiation
  return PluginInfo(
      ...,
      resources=PluginResources(maximum_cpu=2.0, maximum_memory=2048)
  )
  # or, as before, specify just on resource
  return PluginInfo(
      ...,
      resources=PluginResources(maximum_memory=4096)
  )
  ```

## 0.5.1

* Simplify tracelet properties by making the tracelet type prefix optional.

  ```python
  # using a Tracelet object
  trace.add_tracelet(Tracelet("prediction", {
      "type": "example",
      "confidence": 0.8
  }))
  # or without a Tracelet object
  trace.add_tracelet("identity", {"name": "John Doe", "status": "online"})
  ```

* Enabled _manual_ plugin testing, as described on :ref:`advanced use of the test framework in Python<python testing>`.

## 0.5.0

* Support vector data type in trace properties.

  ```python
  embedding = Vector.from_sequence((width, height))
  tracelet = Tracelet("prediction", {
      "prediction.type": "example-vector",
      "prediction.embedding": embedding
  })
  trace.add_tracelet(tracelet)
  ```

## 0.4.13

* When writing input search traces for tests, it is no longer required to explicitly set an `id` property.
  These are automatically generated when executing tests.

## 0.4.7

* More `$data` matchers are supported in Hansken.py plugin runner. Before this improvement it was only possible to match
  on `$data.type`. Now it is also possible to match for example on `$data.mimeType` and `$data.mimeClass`. The `$data`
  matcher should still be at the end of the query as before.

## 0.4.6

* It is now possible to specify maximum system resources in the `PluginInfo`. To run a plugin with 0.5 cpu (= 0.5
  vCPU/Core/hyperthread) and 1 gb memory, for example, the following configuration can be added to `PluginInfo`:

  ```python
  plugin_info = PluginInfo(...,
                           resources=PluginResources.builder().maximum_cpu(0.5).maximum_memory(1000).build())
  ```

## 0.4.0

* Extraction Plugins are now identified with a `PluginInfo.PluginId` containing a domain, category and name. The
  method `PluginInfo.name(pluginName)` has been replaced by `PluginInfo.id(new PluginId(domain, category, name)`. More
  details on the plugin naming conventions can be found at the :doc:`../concepts/plugin_naming_convention` section.

* `PluginInfo.name()` is now deprecated (but will still work for backwards compatibility).

* A new license field `PluginInfo.license` has also been added in this release.

* The following example creates a PluginInfo for a plugin with the name `TestPlugin`, licensed under
  the `Apache License 2.0` license:

  ```python
  class TestPlugin(ExtractionPlugin):
      def plugin_info(self) -> PluginInfo:
          return PluginInfo(self,
                            version='1.0.0',
                            description='A plugin for testing.',
                            author=Author('The Externals', 'tester@holmes.nl', 'NFI'),
                            maturity=MaturityLevel.PROOF_OF_CONCEPT,
                            webpage_url='https://hansken.org',
                            matcher='file.extension=txt',
                            id=PluginId(domain='nfi.nl', category='test', name='TestPlugin'),
                            license='Apache License 2.0'
                            )
  ```

## 0.3.0

* Extraction Plugins can now create new datastreams on a Trace through data transformations. Data transformations
  describe how data can be obtained from a source.

  An example case is an extraction plugin that processes an archive file. The plugin creates a child trace per entry in
  the archive file. Each child trace will have a datastream that is a transformation that marks the start and length of
  the entry in the original archive data. By just describing the data instead of specifying the actual data, a lot of
  space is saved.

  Although Hansken supports various transformations, the Extraction Plugins SDK for now only supports ranged data
  transformations. Ranged data transformations define data as a list of ranges, each range with an offset and length in
  a bytearray.

  The following example sets a new datastream with dataType `html` on a trace, by setting a ranged data transformation:

  ```python
  trace.add_transformation('html', RangedTransformation(Range(offset, length)))
  ```

  The following example creates a child trace and sets a new datastream with dataType `raw` on it, by setting a ranged
  data transformation with two ranges:

  ```python
  child = trace.child_builder('new trace')
  child.add_transformation('raw', RangedTransformation.builder()
                                                      .add_range(10, 20)
                                                      .add_range(50, 30)
                                                      .build())
  });
  ```

  More detailed documentation will follow in an upcoming SDK release.

## 0.2.0

.. warning:: This is an API breaking change.
   Plugins created with an earlier version of the extraction plugin
   SDK are not compatible with Hansken that uses `0.2.0` or later.

* Introduced a new extraction plugin type `api.extraction_plugin.DeferredExtractioPlugin`.
  Deferred Extraction plugins can be run at a different extraction stage.
  This type of plugin also allows accessing other traces using the searcher.

* The class `api.extraction_context.ExtractionContext` has been renamed to `api.data_context.DataContext`.
  The new name `DataContext` represents the class contents better.
  Plugins have to update matching import statements accordingly.
  Plugins should also update the named argument `context` to `data_context` of the plugin `process()` method.
  This change has no functional changes.

  Old:

  ```python
  from hansken_extraction_plugin.api.extraction_context import ExtractionContext

  def process(self, trace, context):
    pass
  ```

  New:

  ```python
  from hansken_extraction_plugin.api.data_context import DataContext

  def process(self, trace, data_context):
    pass
  ```

* Moved `api.author.Author` to `api.plugin_info.Author`, and moved `api.maturity_level.MaturityLevel`
  to `api.plugin_info.MaturityLevel`
  This is a more *pythonic* way of grouping of classes into modules. This change has no functional side effects.

  Plugins have to update matching import statements accordingly.

  Old:

  ```python
  from hansken_extraction_plugin.api.author import Author
  from hansken_extraction_plugin.api.maturity_level import MaturityLevel
  from hansken_extraction_plugin.api.plugin_info import PluginInfo
  ```

  New:

  ```python
  from hansken_extraction_plugin.api.plugin_info import Author, MaturityLevel, PluginInfo
  ```

* Removed `DataContext.get_first_bytes()` from the public API.

* Removed `api.extraction_trace.validate_update_arguments(..)` from the public API. This method is still invoked
  implicitly when setting trace properties.
