# Plugin isolation

Extraction plugins allows arbitrary code to be executed during a Hansken extraction. This code is executed inside the
Hansken cluster. Extraction plugins are subjected
to [Hanskens design principles](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742287615000857?via%3Dihub)
such as security, privacy and transparency. To ensure that plugins are compliant to these principles, each plugin will
be executed in isolation. This page describes the isolation measures that are in place.

## User isolation

The following user restrictions are implied on the plugin:

* The plugin can not run as `root`.
* Instead, the plugin will run as user `1000`
* and with group `2000`
* and with fsgroup `3000`

## System calls

Plugins are only allowed to call a limited set of (Linux) system calls. This ensures that a plugin can be executed in a
secure manner within the Hansken platform.

Hansken uses Kubernetes to run extraction plugins. The Kubernetes `RuntimeDefault` secure computing mode (`seccomp`) is
enabled to provide a sane default of available system calls.

## Network isolation

Plugins are not allowed to communicate over the network.
